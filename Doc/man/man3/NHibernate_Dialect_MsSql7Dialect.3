.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
An SQL dialect compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 7\&. 

There have been no test run with this because the \fBNHibernate\fP team does not have a machine with Sql 7 installed on it\&. But there have been users using Ms Sql 7 with \fBNHibernate\fP\&. As issues with Ms Sql 7 and \fBNHibernate\fP become known this \fBDialect\fP will be updated\&.

.PP
Uses @identity to get the \fBId\fP value\&. There is a well known problem with @identity and triggers that insert into rows into other tables that also use an identity column\&. The only way I know of to get around this problem is to upgrade your database server to Ms Sql 2000\&.
