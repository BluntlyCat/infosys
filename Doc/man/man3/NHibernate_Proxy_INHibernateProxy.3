.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A marker interface so \fBNHibernate\fP can know if it is dealing with an object that is a \fBProxy\fP\&. 

This interface should not be implemented by anything other than the Dynamically generated \fBProxy\fP\&. If it is implemented by a class then \fBNHibernate\fP will think that class is a \fBProxy\fP and will not work\&. 
.PP
It has to be public scope because the Proxies are created in a separate DLL than \fBNHibernate\fP\&.
