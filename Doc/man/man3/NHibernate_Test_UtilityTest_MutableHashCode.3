.SH NAME
NHibernate.Test.UtilityTest.MutableHashCode \- 
.PP
Provides an object whose HashCode is based on a Mutable field\&. Not a good practice but perfect for testing IdentityMap because it simulates an object being loaded with its default constructor (no params) and then having the fields initialized\&. If the class overrides GetHashCode() then it will be inconsistent between the construction and field population by \fBNHibernate\fP\&.
