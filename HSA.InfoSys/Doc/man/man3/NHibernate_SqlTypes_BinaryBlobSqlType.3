.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Describes the details of a DbType\&.Binary that is stored in a BLOB column with the information required to generate an IDbDataParameter\&. 

This can store the length of the binary data that the IDbDataParameter can hold\&. If no value is provided for the length then the \fC\fBDriver\fP\fP is responsible for setting the properties on the IDbDataParameter correctly\&. 
.PP
This is only needed by DataProviders (SqlClient) that need to specify a Size for the IDbDataParameter\&. Most DataProvider(Oralce) don't need to set the Size so a \fBBinarySqlType\fP would work just fine\&.
