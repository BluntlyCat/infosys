.PP 
Implement this interface to provide customized logging event filtering 

Users should implement this interface to implement customized logging event filtering\&. Note that \fBlog4net\&.Repository\&.Hierarchy\&.Logger\fP and \fBlog4net\&.Appender\&.AppenderSkeleton\fP, the parent class of all standard appenders, have built-in filtering rules\&. It is suggested that you first use and understand the built-in rules before rushing to write your own custom filters\&. 
.PP
This abstract class assumes and also imposes that filters be organized in a linear chain\&. The \fBDecide\fP method of each filter is called sequentially, in the order of their addition to the chain\&. 
.PP
The \fBDecide\fP method must return one of the integer constants FilterDecision\&.Deny, FilterDecision\&.Neutral or FilterDecision\&.Accept\&. 
.PP
If the value FilterDecision\&.Deny is returned, then the log event is dropped immediately without consulting with the remaining filters\&. 
.PP
If the value FilterDecision\&.Neutral is returned, then the next filter in the chain is consulted\&. If there are no more filters in the chain, then the log event is logged\&. Thus, in the presence of no filters, the default behavior is to log all logging events\&. 
.PP
If the value FilterDecision\&.Accept is returned, then the log event is logged without consulting the remaining filters\&. 
.PP
The philosophy of \fBlog4net\fP filters is largely inspired from the Linux ipchains\&.

.SS "\fBFilterDecision\fP log4net\&.Filter\&.IFilter\&.Decide (\fBLoggingEvent\fPloggingEvent)"

.PP
Decide if the logging event should be logged through an appender\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIloggingEvent\fP The LoggingEvent to decide upon
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
The decision of the filter
.RE
.PP
.PP
If the decision is FilterDecision\&.Deny, then the event will be dropped\&. If the decision is FilterDecision\&.Neutral, then the next filter, if any, will be invoked\&. If the decision is FilterDecision\&.Accept then the event will be logged without consulting with other filters in the chain\&. 
.PP
Implemented in \fBlog4net\&.Filter\&.StringMatchFilter\fP, \fBlog4net\&.Filter\&.LevelRangeFilter\fP, \fBlog4net\&.Filter\&.FilterSkeleton\fP, \fBlog4net\&.Filter\&.LoggerMatchFilter\fP, \fBlog4net\&.Filter\&.LevelMatchFilter\fP, \fBlog4net\&.Filter\&.PropertyFilter\fP, and \fBlog4net\&.Filter\&.DenyAllFilter\fP\&.

.PP
Property to get and set the next filter The next filter in the chain 
.PP
Filters are typically composed into chains\&. This property allows the next filter in the chain to be accessed\&.
