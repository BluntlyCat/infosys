.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Acts as a stand-in for an entity identifier which is supposed to be generated on insert (like an IDENTITY column) where the insert needed to be delayed because we were outside a transaction when the persist occurred (save currently still performs the insert)\&. 

The stand-in is only used within the see cref='NHibernate\&.Engine\&.PersistenceContext' in order to distinguish one instance from another; it is never injected into the entity instance or returned to the client\&.\&.\&.
